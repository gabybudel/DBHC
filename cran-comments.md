## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Made the variable calls in 'plotfunctions.R' binding. Thanks to Uwe Ligges 
  pointing out where the problem occurrs, I know found a way to prevent this 
  problem from occurring. 


## Test environments
* local Windows 10 install, R 3.4.4
* Ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.4.4

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs, or NOTEs.
