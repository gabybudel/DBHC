## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Removed the assumption that class of matrix has length 1
* Made smaller example execute on test
* Added test directory with simple test for error


## Test environments
* local Windows 10 install, R 4.2.2
* Ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.4.4

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs, or NOTEs.
