Description: Provides an implementation of a mixture of hidden Markov models 
    (HMMs) for discrete sequence data in the Discrete Bayesian HMM Clustering 
    (DBHC) algorithm. The DBHC algorithm is an HMM Clustering 
    algorithm that finds a mixture of discrete-output HMMs while using 
    heuristics based on Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to search for the 
    optimal number of HMM states and the optimal number of clusters.
